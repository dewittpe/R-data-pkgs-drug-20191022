# R Data Packages

**Presentation to the Denver R User Group on 22 October 2019**

One part of collaborative data analysis requires all analysts to have access to the
same data sources.  Depending on the data, granting access to everyone can be
difficult.

There are many ways data could be provided so that everyone is using the same
version.  This talk looks at building a solution for larger than memory static
data for which common database access is not a viable option.  Regardless of the
size of your data set the construction of an R data package is a good way to
document and archive data sets.
